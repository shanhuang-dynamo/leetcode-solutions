# Leetcode Java Solutions
Causion: the files and file NOs are generated by the ruby script, it might not exactly corresponding to the original problem set NOs.

## About the solutions
Currently the solutions are just the 1st try code writen by me(robturtle). Seems the author haven't done any OJ before, it's very likely the initial implementations are naive and in ugly form. Feel free to fork it and pull request for the best practice.

## Don't like its ugly implementation?
It's fine. Feel free to fork the [empty branch](https://github.com/leetcode-study-group/leetcode-java-solutions/tree/empty) for your own convenience.
